Basics
    What is TypeScript ?
        TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning that it does everything that JavaScript does, but with some added features.
        The main reason for using TypeScript is to add static typing to JavaScript. Static typing means that the type of a variable cannot be changed at any point in a program. It can prevent a LOT of bugs which is present in Javascript using dynamic typing.
        TypeScript cannot be understood by browsers, so it has to be compiled into JavaScript by the TypeScript Compiler (TSC)
    
    Why you should use TypeScript ?
        Research has shown that TypeScript can spot 15% of common bugs.
        Readability – it is easier to see what the code it supposed to do. And when working in a team, it is easier to see what the other developers intended to.
    
    Drawbacks of TypeScript
        TypeScript takes longer to write than JavaScript, as you have to specify types, so for smaller solo projects it might not be worth using it.
        TypeScript has to be compiled – which can take time, especially in larger projects.

    Use Typescript
        Install: We need to install typescript globally to use it
            npm i -g typescript

        **save the file in .ts extenstion

        Compile :We need to compile the typescript code into js code.
            ** An interesting thing about TypeScript is that it reports errors in your text editor whilst you are coding, but it will always compile your code – whether there are errors or not. 

            Normal: it creates a index.js file.
                tsc index
            Output file : If you want to specify the name of the output file
                tsc index.ts --outfile file-name.js
            Watch Flag : If you want TSC to compile your code automatically, whenever you make a change
                tsc index.ts -w // error will shown in realtime
            
            Compile every file and watch 
                tsc -w
        
        Set Up the TS Config File (tsconfig.json)
            Should be in root directory and in this file we can specify the root files, compiler options, and how strict we want TypeScript to be in checking our project.
            **When input files are specified on the command line (for example, tsc index), tsconfig.json files are ignored.
        
        Mixin :
        By default typescript cannot intert more than 1 class.
        So to eliminate this limitation, we can use mixin which enables us to use methods of those class in the parent class
