LoopBack v4

Basics
    A highly extensible Node.js and TypeScript framework for building APIs and microservices.

Setup 
    Install loopback cli global
    $ npm install -g @loopback/cli

    Create a new project
    $lb4 app

    Starting the project :
    The project comes with a "ping" route to test the project. Let's try it out by running the projects. 
    $ cd getting-started
    $ npm start
    In a browser, visit http://127.0.0.1:3000/ping

    Add your own controller
     $ lb4 controller
        [?] Controller class name: hello
        [?] What kind of controller would you like to generate? Empty Controller
        create src/controllers/hello.controller.ts
        update src/controllers/index.ts
        Controller Hello was now created in src/controllers/ 

    Create Model :
        $lb4 model
    
    Adding Database :
        $lb4 datasource
    
    Adding Repository :
        $lb4 repository
    
    Adding Controller :
        $lb4 controller

If we Db is empty and model is set and we want to create a table which is same as model then in index.ts before app.start type app.migrateSchema.
It will create a table with the database.
